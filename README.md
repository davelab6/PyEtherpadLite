This python api enables easy interaction with the Etherpad Lite API.
Etherpad Lite is a collaborative editor provided by the Etherpad Foundation.

#1 Disclaimer

This is just a Proof of Concept of a CLI tracking of etherpadlite.
Will work only with the etherpad-lite fork over here: 

    https://github.com/guyzmo/etherpad-lite

I have extended the API of etherpad in order to be able to have more
informations from the server, and display a local copy of the text
in the terminal.

In the end, I hope I'll have the time to make something useful out of it.
